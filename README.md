# Spotify super awesome visualizer

Log into spotify and display some visuals to your current track(based on its album cover).

## Base for the project

I started writing this thing based on this search app:
https://github.com/myogeshchavan97/spotify-music-search-app
Then I implemented Profile card and another page just for visualization.
The image recognition API shoud analize the cover and adjust the colours.

## Next steps and challenges

-get more details about a current track(tempo, mood) which will allow to create more diverse visuals
-player bar at the bottom of the page
-make more thing clickable(like top artists and stuff...)

### Main dependencies, libraries, frameworks

-Redux(kinda must-have)  
\_Lodash(highly useful)  
-Material-UI(just to try it)  
-Final-Form  
-Axios  

### APIs:

-Spotify Web API  
-Imagga API
